## Upgrade your project

<div style="display: flex; flex-wrap: wrap">
<div style="flex-basis: 200px; flex-grow: 1; margin-right: 15px;">
Add more to your project. Perhaps you could change the difficulty level or add more circles to your target.

You could:

+ Add a `fourth` and `fifth` circle, in new colours, that score different points based on their position
+ Put emoji in your print messages ([here's a list of emoji](https://unicode.org/emoji/charts/full-emoji-list.html){:target="_blank"} you can copy from)
+ Make the game easier or harder by changing the `frame_rate(5)` value
+ Use `input()` to ask the user which difficulty level they want to play at

Open the [Archery starter](https://trinket.io/python/9973649e5c){:target="_blank"} project.

The starter project has some code already written for you. 

Click 'Run' to see a 400 x 250 pixel blue filled rectangle drawn at the top of the screen. This is the sky.

**Tip:** Coordinates start from (x=0, y=0) in the top left corner. This might be different to other coordinate systems you have used.

The sky has been drawn with a black border (stroke). 

To turn `stroke` off for all shapes add `no_stroke()` to the `setup` function:

--- code ---
---
language: python
filename: main.py â€” draw()
line_numbers: true
line_number_start: 11
line_highlights: 15
---
def setup():
# Setup your game here
  size(400, 400) # width and height of screen
  frame_rate(2)
  no_stroke()

--- /code ---

--- /task ---

--- task ---

**Run** your code again and notice ðŸ‘€ that the border (stroke) has now disappeared.

### Draw the grass

--- task ---

The `fill` function sets the colour for the inside of a shape.

Set the `fill` colour to `grass` and add another `rect(x, y, width, height)`.

language: python
filename: main.py â€” draw()
line_numbers: true
line_number_start: 24
line_highlights: 26-27

  fill(sky)     
  rect(0, 0, 400, 250) # x, y, width, height    
  fill(grass)    
  rect(0, 250, 400, 150) # x, y, width, height

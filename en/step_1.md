## Introduction

Use Python to draw a target and score points by hitting it with arrows. 

You will:
 + Personalise your game with **RGB colours**
 + Use **conditional statements** (`if`, `elif`, `else` ) to make decisions
 + Position shapes with **x, y coordinates**

The <span style="color: #0faeb0; font-weight: bold;"> RGB colour model </span> uses the primary colours of light: red, green, and blue (RGB). The RGB colours each have a value between 0 and 255, that combine to create a different colour. For example <span style="color: #800080;">purple</span> would have values R,G,B (128, 0, 128) â€” equal amounts of red and blue, with no green. People such as Video Game Artists and Graphic Designers use the RGB colour model in their work.

### Try it
<div style="display: flex; flex-wrap: wrap">
<div style="flex-basis: 175px; flex-grow: 1">  
Click the **Run** button below to start the game. When the dot appears close to the centre of the target, click the mouse (or tap on a tablet) to fire your arrow. 

What changes if the arrow is in different places when you click?

The oldest evidence of <span style="color: #0faeb0; font-weight: bold;"> archery </span> comes to us from the Sibudu Cave in KwaZulu-Natal, South Africa. Remains of stone and bone arrowheads have been found which date to 60,000 to 70,000 years ago.

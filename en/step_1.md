## Introduction

Use Python, with the p5 graphics library, to draw a target and score points by hitting it with arrows. 

You will:
 + Personalise your game with **RGB colours**
 + Use **conditional statements** (`if`, `elif`, `else` ) to make decisions
 + Position shapes with **x, y coordinates**

 <span style="color: #0faeb0; font-weight: bold;"> RGB colours </span> have values between 0 and 255 for each of R(ed), G(reen) and B(lue). <span style="color: #800080;">Purple</span> has values R,G,B (128, 0, 128) â€” medium amounts of red and blue, with no green. Video Game Artists and Graphic Designers work with RGB colours.

### Try it
<div style="display: flex; flex-wrap: wrap">
<div style="flex-basis: 175px; flex-grow: 1">  
Click the **Run** button below to start the game. When the dot appears on the target, click the mouse (or tap on a tablet) to fire your arrow. 

Have a few goes. Your score appears in the output area below the target. How does your score change when the arrow lands on different colours?

The oldest evidence of <span style="color: #0faeb0; font-weight: bold;"> archery </span> comes to us from the Sibudu Cave in KwaZulu-Natal, South Africa. Remains of stone and bone arrowheads have been found which date to 60,000 to 70,000 years ago.

### Draw the stand

The triangular wooden stand is partly behind the target circles so it must be drawn first. 

--- task ---

Draw a brown `triangle()` with corners at coordinates (150, 350), (200, 150), and (250, 350).

### Draw the target circles

The target circles will cover the brown triangle where they overlap, because they are drawn later. 

--- task ---

The largest part of the target will be a blue **circle** made by using the `ellipse()` function.

An ellipse is a shape with a single side and no corners. It can be squashed, like an oval, or perfecly round, like a circle. 

An ellipse needs `x` and `y` coordinates, width, and height. The `x` and `y` coordinates of an ellipse are the centre position. 

**Tip:** To make a circle, the **width** and **height** must be the same.

  ellipse(200, 200, 170, 170) # Outer circle. 200, 200 is the middle of the screen

**Test:** Run your code to see the first large blue circle.

--- task ---

Create two new variables called `inner` and `bullseye` to store colours for the remaining circles. 

The `color()` function expects three numbers: one each for red, green, and blue.

We used numbers that give traditional archery target colours, but you can use whatever colours you like as long as they are different from each other.

The target is made of different-sized circles with the same centre coordinates (200, 200) â€” the middle of the screen. 

Add two more circles to represent an inner circle and the bullseye. Change the `fill()` before drawing each circle.

  fill(outer)   
  ellipse(200, 200, 170, 170) # Outer circle   
  fill(inner)   
  ellipse(200, 200, 110, 110) # Inner circle   
  fill(bullseye)   
  ellipse(200, 200, 30, 30) # Bullseye   
  
--- /code ---

--- /task ---

--- task ---

**Test:** Run your project again to see the target with three coloured circles. Change the colours until you are happy with them.

**Debug:** Python uses the American spelling of 'color' (without a 'u') so make sure you do the same.

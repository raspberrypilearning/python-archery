### Desenhe um suporte triangular

--- task ---

Set the fill colour to `sienna` (brown).

Desenhe um triÃ¢ngulo usando as coordenadas x e y para cada um dos cantos.

![Um triÃ¢ngulo marrom na grama e um cÃ©u com os pontos de coordenadas rotulados em 150, 350 e 200, 150 e 250, 350). The corners of the canvas are also labelled as x=0, y=0 in the top left and x=400, y=400 in the bottom right.](images/stand_coords.png){:width="400px"}

### Desenhe os cÃ­rculos do alvo

--- task ---

The largest part of the target is a blue **circle**.

Set the fill colour to `blue`.

Draw a circle with x and y coordinates for its centre and a width.

**Test:** Run your code to see the first large blue circle.

The blue circle was drawn after the stand so it is in front.

    circle(200, 200, 170)  # Draw the outer circle
    fill('red')  # Set the colour for the circle fill to red
